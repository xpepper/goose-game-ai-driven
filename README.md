[Goose Game kata](https://github.com/xpeppers/goose-game-kata), done in pair with GitHub Copilot, to sharpen my prompt engineering skills and reflect on the communication patterns to adopt when pairing with an AI-assisted coding tool ðŸ˜„...

Along with the code, you can find the prompts I used to guide the pair programming session in the `prompts` folder.
I created a new prompt file for each new step we made. I put more prompts in the same file, separated by a `---` line, when a single prompt did not result in all tests passing.
