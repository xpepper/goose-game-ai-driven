I'd like to do a coding kata with you, to practice together TDD, refactoring and software design.
We'll try to follow TDD and its steps quite strictly.
We are going to code the kata in Kotlin, using a simple project setup in Gradle.
The kata is the following: https://github.com/xpeppers/goose-game-kata
We will start with the first feature, with the TDD cycle of adding a test, make it pass, refactor the code, and repeat.
We'll work in small steps, iteratively.

The first feature is the following:

---
### 1. Add players
As a player, I want to add me to the game so that I can play.

**Scenarios:**
1. Add Player
   ```cucumber
   If there is no participant
   the user writes: "add player Pippo"
   the system responds: "players: Pippo"
   the user writes: "add player Pluto"
   the system responds: "players: Pippo, Pluto"
   ```

2. Duplicated Player
   ```cucumber
   If there is already a participant "Pippo"
   the user writes: "add player Pippo"
   the system responds: "Pippo: already existing player"
   ```
---

You are going to write the first test, and then I'm going to give you feedback on its quality.
If the test is ok to me, we'll move on to implement the application code that we'll make the test pass. Then we will look for any opportunity to make the code clearer, easier to understand by refactoring it.
