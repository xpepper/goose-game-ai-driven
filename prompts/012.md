Ok, now let's move to the next feature, which is the following

### 2. Move a player
As a player, I want to move the marker on the board to make the game progress

**Scenarios:**
1. Start
   ```cucumber
   If there are two participants "Pippo" and "Pluto" on space "Start"
   the user writes: "move Pippo 4, 2"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 4, 2. Pippo moves from Start to 6"
   the user writes: "move Pluto 2, 2"
   the system responds: "Pluto rolls 2, 2. Pluto moves from Start to 4"
   the user writes: "move Pippo 2, 3"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 2, 3. Pippo moves from 6 to 11"
   ```

Let's start with a new test.
