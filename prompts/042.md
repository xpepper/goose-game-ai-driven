I'm curious to see the shape of the code once we'll implement the next scenario, "multiple jumps". Let's write a test for this scenario.

---
Ok. The test looks good to me. Let's make the tests green again by implementing this missing behaviour.

---
The test is still red. I think we should also change generateMoveMessage to print the correct message.
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
Actual   :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 18 to 22
```

---
Still not working.
The test `when a player lands on The Goose, they move again` fails with the message
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 3 to 5, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 7
Actual   :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 5 to 5, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 7
```

The test `when a player lands on The Goose consecutively, they move again multiple times` fails with
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
Actual   :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 18 to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
```

---
No, now a lot of tests break. Let's start from scratch, shall we?
I'm going to rollback all the changes I made after we added the new test `when a player lands on The Goose consecutively, they move again multiple times`, so that just our new test is still broken and we can start with a new try on making it pass

---
We are still in the same situation we were a few minutes ago: two failing tests.
Our last test `when a player lands on The Goose consecutively, they move again multiple times` fails with the message
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
Actual   :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 18 to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
```

---
The test is still failing.
The failing message is
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
Actual   :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 18 to 22
```

---
No, the test is still failing
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
Actual   :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 18 to 22
```
It seems that we cannot print the correct positions in which the player moves while jumping on the goose spaces

---
No, the test is still failing with the same message
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22
Actual   :Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 18 to 22
```

Shall we start from scratch again from the last test written to try a new approach?

---
No, the test is still failing with the same message

Shall we start from scratch again from the last test written to try a new approach?

---
No, we seem to be stuck in the same loop of trial and error.
I rolled back again to the last test that we wrote, `when a player lands on The Goose consecutively, they move again multiple times`, which is the only one failing. All the other tests are green.
Now, let's try to be very careful and make the minimal changes that allow the new test to pass.

---
No, we are still stuck in the same failing tests.
Let's try to address the other failing test, `when a player lands on The Goose, they move again`. It fails with
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 3 to 5, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 7
Actual   :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 3 to 7
```
It seems the issue is that moving happens in `Player`, while printing the message happens in `Game`.

---
No, we're still with a lot of tests failing. Sounds like we're on a dead end.
I'm going to rollback again to go back to when we just added the last test.

No, we're still with a lot of tests failing. It sounds like we're on a dead end. I'm going to roll back again to go back to when we just added the last test.

---
Let's try this: can we refactor the code so that `Player` keeps track of all the positions it went through, not just the current and the previous?

---
I would like that also the other `Player` methods could use that new strategy.
For example, `fun getPosition(): Int = position` could be refactored in
`fun getPosition(): Int = positions.last()`...

---
The test `when a player lands on space 6, The Bridge, they jump to space 12` is now failing with
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 4 to The Bridge. Pippo jumps to 12
Actual   :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 4 to The Bridge. Pippo jumps to 6
```

---
No, the test is still failing

---
Great, the tests are now green!
