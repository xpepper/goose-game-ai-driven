Ok. The test looks good to me. Let's make the tests green again by implementing this missing behaviour.

---
The test we just added (`when a player rolls a number that would move them beyond space 63, they bounce back off the end of the track`) is still broken:
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 5. Pippo moves from 60 to 63. Pippo bounces! Pippo returns to 62
Actual   :Pippo rolls 5. Pippo moves from 60 to 61
```

---
No, you are proposing a wrong change on `Game` and `Player`, because `rollDice` does not exist (we did not perform that change), instead `Player` has a `move` method.

---
Wrong again: you are changing the signature of `fun movePlayer(name: String, roll: Int)` which was `fun movePlayer(name: String, dice: Dice)`

---
Great, now the tests are all passing. Good job!
