Ok, do you see any refactoring opportunity before moving on to the next test?

Remember, we are doing TDD, so we should not spend a lot of time in any of the three steps (write a test, make it pass, refactor). We should proceed step by step, with tiny steps, incrementally shaping the solution with an emergent design. So we should avoid performing speculative design, but instead follow mainly our current needs, the ones defined by our actual features and the next feature we are going to support.

Ok, I agree we may extract the magic number 63, but I'm not sure what would be a good name for this... I tried naming it `LAST_POSITION`.
