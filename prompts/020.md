Ok, now let's move to the next feature, which is the following:

---
### 3. Win
As a player, I win the game if I land on space "63"

**Scenarios:**
1. Victory
   ```cucumber
   If there is one participant "Pippo" on space "60"
   the user writes: "move Pippo 1, 2"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 1, 2. Pippo moves from 60 to 63. Pippo Wins!!"
   ```

2. Winning with the exact dice shooting
   ```cucumber
   If there is one participant "Pippo" on space "60"
   the user writes: "move Pippo 3, 2"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 3, 2. Pippo moves from 60 to 63. Pippo bounces! Pippo returns to 61"
   ```

As usual, let's start with a new test for the first scenario of this feature: `Victory`.
