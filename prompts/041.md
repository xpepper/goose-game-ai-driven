Ok, now let's move to the next feature.
Remember we're doing TDD and we are pair programming.
Now it's your turn to write the test.

The next feature is the following:

### 6. If you land on "The Goose", move again
As a player, when I get to a space with a picture of "The Goose", I move forward again by the sum of the two dice rolled before

The spaces 5, 9, 14, 18, 23, 27 have a picture of "The Goose"

**Scenarios:**
1. Single Jump
   ```cucumber
   If there is one participant "Pippo" on space "3"
   assuming that the dice get 1 and 1
   when the user writes: "move Pippo"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 3 to 5, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 7"
   ```

2. Multiple Jump
   ```cucumber
   If there is one participant "Pippo" on space "10"
   assuming that the dice get 2 and 2
   when the user writes: "move Pippo"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 2, 2. Pippo moves from 10 to 14, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 18, The Goose. Pippo moves again and goes to 22"
   ```
   
Let's start with the test for the first scenario of the feature, the "single jump".

The test looks good to me.
Let's implement the first scenario, so that this test will now pass. We should also take care of the other tests, just in case anyone of them broke due to our change.

Great job, you nailed it at the first shoot. The tests are all green. Good job
