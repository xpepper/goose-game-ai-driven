I would prefer to have the dice rolling outside the `movePlayer` method, so that we could pass the dice to that method instead of passing along the two ints... smells like a "primitive obsession", but maybe it's too early to follow this smell and introduce an abstraction... What do you think?

We also need to change the generateMoveMessage to complete the proposed refactoring, right?

---
We also need to adapt the tests to this refactoring, right?

I prefer mockk to mockito. Could you change the test code to use mockito and also tell me how to change the `build.gradle` to add mockk dependency?

---
please remember I use Gradle with the Kotlin DSL when proposing changes to the `build.gradle.kts` file.
