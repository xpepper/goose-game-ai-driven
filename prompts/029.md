Ok, now let's move to the next feature.
Remember we're doing TDD and we are pair programming.
Now it's your turn to write the test.

The next feature is the following:

---
### 5. Space "6" is "The Bridge"
As a player, when I get on the space "The Bridge", I jump to the space "12"

**Scenarios:**
1. Get to "The Bridge"
   ```cucumber
   If there is one participant "Pippo" on space "4"
   assuming that the dice get 1 and 1
   when the user writes: "move Pippo"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 4 to The Bridge. Pippo jumps to 12"
   ```
---
Ok, the test looks good to me. I just slightly change the title of the test to when a player lands on space 6, The Bridge, they jump to space 12

---
So, let's now let this test pass by changing the application code.

---
The added test still doesn't pass:
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 4 to The Bridge. Pippo jumps to 12
Actual   :Pippo rolls 1, 1. Pippo moves from 4 to 12
```
I think the change made on `generateMoveMessage` is not correct.

---
Great! I fixed another broken test because the player was moving through the bridge due to its testing data. I changed the testing data to avoid the bridge for that test case
