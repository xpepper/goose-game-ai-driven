Ok, do you see any refactoring opportunity before going to the next test? 
Remember, we are doing TDD, so we should not spend a lot of time in one of the three steps (write a test, make it pass, refactor). We should proceed step by step, with tiny steps, incrementally shaping the solution with an emergent design. So we should avoid performing speculative design, but instead follow mainly our current needs, the one defined by our actual features and the next feature we have to support.

I agree with your refactoring proposal, but please use the current shape of Game, Player and Dice to perform the refactoring. For example, Game does have a move method, not a movePlayer method...

---
No, this is not what I meant. Your proposal is ok, but you should start from the actual shape of the code to propose the changes. Please try again with the refactorings you proposed, aka:
- Extracting the bounce logic into a separate method: The logic for handling the bounce when a player's roll would move them beyond space 63 is currently inside the move method of the `Player` class and the `generateMoveMessage` method of the Game class. This logic could be extracted into a separate method in the `Player` class, which would make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Improving the naming of methods and variables: Some of the method and variable names could be more descriptive. For example, the `move` method in the `Player` class could be renamed to `moveAndBounceIfNecessary` to more accurately describe what the method does.

Never mind. We seem to not get this refactoring right, so let's start from scratch. Do you see any refactoring opportunity before going to the next test? Remember, we are doing TDD, so we should not spend a lot of time in any of the three steps (write a test, make it pass, refactor). We should proceed step by step, with tiny steps, incrementally shaping the solution with an emergent design.

Let's try again doing these refactoring one by one and NOT all together. This way we made small changes that are easily verifiable.

---
Right, but stick to the move method on `Player`, instead of proposing also to change `move` to `moveAndBounceIfNecessary`. Let's make one change at a time.

---
Ok, I think I'm going to take be the driver, and let you do the navigator in our pair programming session now. I liked one of the proposals you made on how to refactor our code before moving to the next test, e.g. extracting the bouncing logic. 
I performed the refactoring (in `generateMoveMessage`), what do you think? It's ok by you?
