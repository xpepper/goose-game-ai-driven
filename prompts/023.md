Ok, do you see any refactoring opportunity before going to the next test?

I don't like this improvement proposal, because it would sound not very aligned with the domain model of the Goose Game board game... I mean, does really a "player" move a dice? It would be better to have a player to "roll a dice" and then "move" based on the result of the dice.

No, I'm still not sure if I like the way the code is going. 
What about moving to the next test and then see if this triggers more clear refactoring opportunities?

Ok, so let's move to the next scenario by implementing the next test on the player bouncing.
