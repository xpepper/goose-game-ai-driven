A question: in the `generateMoveMessage` method, when checking the "bridge" condition, do we really need to check also that `player.getPosition() == 12`? Isn't enough to check that `oldPosition + dice.sum == 6`.
I run the tests without the `player.getPosition() == 12` condition, and they are still passing. Are we missing any corner case in our tests? Or the `player.getPosition() == 12` is redundant?
