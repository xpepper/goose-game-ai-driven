I also agree with the second proposed refactoring

```
Simplify Conditional Expressions: In the generateMoveMessage method, you could simplify the conditional expressions by extracting them into separate methods in the Player class. For example, you could create a method Player.landedOnTheBridge() that checks if oldPosition + dice.sum == THE_BRIDGE.
```
but consider that `oldPosition` and `dice.sum` does not depend on the `Player`.

---
Mmmmm... I don't like this refactoring move. What about instead moving the oldPosition to `Player` class then?

---
Ok, looks good. I have to fix also the `bouncedFrom` method, which I also renamed to `bounced`.

---
Ok, I also moved that extension function directly to the `Player` class, as you also were suggesting.
