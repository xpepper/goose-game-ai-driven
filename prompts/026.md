Ok, now let's move to the next feature.
Remember we're doing TDD and we are doing pair programming.
Now it's your turn to write the test.

The next feature is the following:

---
### 4. The game throws the dice
As a player, I want the game to throw the dice for me, to make less effort

**Scenarios:**
1. The game takes care of rolling the dice for me
   ```cucumber
   If there is one participant "Pippo" on space "4"
   assuming that the dice get 1 and 2
   when the user writes: "move Pippo"
   the system responds: "Pippo rolls 1, 2. Pippo moves from 4 to 7"
   ```
---

---
Ok, the test is quite fine. What about passing the player instance to the movePlayer method instead of its name as string?

---
No, sorry, you are right. The movePlayer was already taking the name of the player instead of a player instance, so my bad: we should make a single step at a time. Either we decide to make this refactoring or move to write a test for the new feature. I would prefer to add the test and implement the new feature, and add the refactoring or the movePlayer method in our TODO list. Ok?

---
I prefer the first version of the test that you proposed before, where the dice are rolled by the game:

```kotlin
 @Test
 fun `the game takes care of rolling the dice for the player`() {
     val pippo = Player("Pippo")
     game.addPlayer(pippo)
     pippo.move(4) // Move Pippo to space 4

     val dice = mockk<Dice>()
     every { dice.roll() } returns 3 // 1 + 2
     val response = game.movePlayer("Pippo")

     assertEquals("Pippo rolls 1, 2. Pippo moves from 4 to 7", response)
 }
```

---
Ok, the new test is still failing:
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 1, 2. Pippo moves from 4 to 7
Actual   :Pippo rolls 5. Pippo moves from 4 to 9
```
I think the issue is that we have to pass the `Dice` as a `Game` dependency, when creating a Game instance.

---
Ok, I did the changes needed on the tests too.
Now the test is still failing because the move message is not correct:
```
Expected :Pippo rolls 1, 2. Pippo moves from 4 to 7
Actual   :Pippo rolls 3. Pippo moves from 4 to 7
```
I think we should change the generateMoveMessage method

---
No, I think we should change the Dice to return the values of the two dice instead of the result of their sum.

---
Ok, I also fixed the previous tests, that were wrong (we implemented the previous scenarios not correctly, we did not follow the proper move message format as described in the examples).
