Ok, shall we now refactor the `fun movePlayer(name: String)` to accept a `Player` instance instead of a string?

---
We should keep the check about the player being added to the game, right?
E.g. what happens if I try to move a player that is not part of the game?

---
Ok, I changed the tests to accommodate the change in the movePlayer method. All tests are green now.
